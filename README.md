Project: Create a website with static content and deploy it to AWS using S3, CloudFront and IAM

In this project, I have deployed a static website to AWS using S3, CloudFront, and IAM.

I have renamed "Travel Blog" to "Rahul's Travel Blog" and have updated the background image. I am attaching the screenshots here of the steps I went through.
